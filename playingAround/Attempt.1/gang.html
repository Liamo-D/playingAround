            <h2>His Gang</h2>
            <p>Over the years of his tenure the escapading adventurer we know as Bugs has developed a fellowship of admirers and loathers, each following his footsteps for their own personal 
                reasons, some for personal gain, others for enlightenment, others because they happen to be treading similar paths. All, however, have one thing in common: immortality granted 
                to them by their closeness with Mr Bunny.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>The Pig</h3>
                <p>The Pig has been a member of Bugs's personal circle for quite some time. He has come to many miracles and impossibilities through this connection, all of which he is most gratious for.
                    His entry into the guarded ring has not come without it's forthcomings, however. He has followed Bugs and many other members of the Gang into impossible and death-defying situations.
                    It is not uncommon for him to follow any of these members to the end of the world and past if they need it. What he lacks in personal power he makes up for tenfold through his 
                    indomitable will and unbreakable loyalty to the Gang.

                </div>
                <h3>The Butcher</h3>
                <p>The Butcher has made the Rabbit his sworn enemy since the day he discovered his existence. He has stopped at no end to end the seemingly unending and mysterious life of the Rabbit. It is 
                    now his life's sole mission to find a way to destroy this imperious creature. The Rabbit has questioningly allowed and kept the Butcher as a follower for one simple reason: his own 
                    sadistic joy. He enjoys watching the Butcher get increasingly frustrated as he attempts to kill him, the worlds first unkillable creation. He keeps the Butcher in a trance, never 
                    allowing him to realise his futile ways, and keeping his emotions in a state of perpetual rage.

                </div>
                <h3>Lola Bunny</h3>
                <p>The Lola Bunny, or just "Lola" for short, is the only evidence that Bugs Bunny is natural and of this world, not some god incarnate in the body of an anthropomorphic bunny rabbit. She is 
                    a female version of the same species as Bugs. Although seemingly identical in looks, Lola possesses few if any of the ablilities that make Bugs so terrifying. Her actions and beliefs
                    seem grounded in reality, logical and sane. She is the only creature that can harm Bugs, as their connection is not just a physical one but emotional aswell, and they are bound together
                    by a sense of responsibility, being the only two that can save their kind.

                </div>
                <h3>Daffy Duck</h3>
                <p>Daffy Duck is another creature of similar stature to Bugs. He has shown on multiple accounts that he can also manipulate time and environments to suit his will and his needs. He is more 
                    spontaneous than Bugs, and so is more likely to use his abilities on passers-by. He has shown that he is unstable in many regards, lashing out at minor conveniences, and is prone to
                    impulsiveness. He can be bought and bribed, and currently acts as Bugs' closest friend and partner, a partnership that has lasted uncountable years and from our understanding can never
                    be broken.
