            <h2>Settlements</h2>
            <p>Throughout his long and perpetual life, Bugs Bunny has settled down in many different areas across the globe. For many years he became
                nomadic, travelling around from place to place and experiencing what the area and people had to show before moving on to the next 
                adventure. As his appreciation of time differs from our own, his temporary dwelling in a community may last generations of our own
                lives. As such, we can trace his journeys through stories passed down through generations, and construct an idea of his walk across
                the world.

                </div>
                <h3>California</h3>
                <p>The easiest area to track him down to is the one he is currently abiding in. California has been his and Daffy's home since early
                    2011. He bought the house using a fortune amassed through selling some of his personal belongings, now deemed ancient, antique and 
                    historically prevelant. He lives in a community with five neighbours,none of which approve of himself and Daffy's habits or humour, but 
                    the two apparent demigods never trouble them with imaginitive curses or holds, instead begrudgingly keeping in line with their 
                    HOA's rules and regulations.

                    <img src="img/Bugsun.2.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Bugsun">
                </div>
                <p>The area his influence is most easily seen is in the city of Bugsun. An island in the middle of the Pacific, the area should be home to no 
                    more than farmers and few merchants, living thier simple yet fulfilling lives along and on the sea. Bugsun has instead replaced
                    farmers with scholars and merchants with researchers. The island has become a prestigious place of learning and science, with the best
                    minds across the globe hoping to be accepted to move and live there. Records show that the people there lived a humble and standard 
                    traditional life, until the late eighteenth century. Around that time they began exponentially developing, upgrading their famrs, towns and 
                    technologies. This drastic shift in their behaviours is associated with the arrival of bugs, who they promptly named themselves after. Although
                    Bugs had travelled and talked to many cultures and communities, scientists speculate that his prolonged stay on the island, setting off 
                    in the early twentieth century after an almost one hundred and fifty year stay, and the islanders acceptance of what he had to say is the cause of
                    the rapid development.

                </div>
                <h3>The East</h3>
                <p>Tales of an ancient yet futuristic creature that inhabits the shape of a human but the look of a rabbit are present in many folk tales across the 
                    pacific islands and all throughout east and south-east Asia. His presence left a lasting impression on the peoplehe encountered and they have all 
                    immortalised his interactions through their stories. The chronology of his tour of the world can be seen through the accuracy of the works depicting
                    him, with the more recent visits looking like vague protraits of him and the more ancient visits looking more like somehting out of a sweat-filled
                    nightmare.

                </div>
                <h3>The Middle East, Europe and Africa</h3>
                <p>While it is believed by many that during his nomadic ways he attended the Middle East, Europe and Africa, the evidence is not as abundant as it is 
                    in other areas of the world. In different places scattered around there are tales and warnings involving a large and powerful rabbit, but such
                    stories are vague and often contradict each other, and are just as likely to have developed naturally as as they are if Bugs had actually shown up.
                    Culture and life in these areas also evolved very different to that in the East, so it is not unlikely that Bugs never travelled as far as these 
                    lands, or if he did it was either so long ago that memory cannot recall it, or it was before even human thought had developed.
