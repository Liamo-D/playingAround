            <h2>Preperations</h2>
            <p>Although the Bunny has displayed no outward signs of aggression so far and is seemingly neutral in all current ongoing conflicts, it is an 
                oversight to not prepare for the worst situation, a change of his attitude. If such a situation were to occur, we as a species need to 
                have clauses in place to deal with him. 
            </p>

        <div class="jargon">
            <div class="positions">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="img/DaffyWar.2.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Soldier Daffy">
                </div>
                <h3>Daffy</h3>
                <p>Our primary contingency plan at this current period of time is to manipulate Daffy into going against his long-time partner. He is 
                    the only creature that has a potential equality to Bugs's power. Although unlikely that the two would turn on each other, 
                    Daffy has shown himself to be self-centred and short-sighted. It may be possible to convince him through incentives and false 
                    promises. If this plan were to be successful, however, it wouldleave us again unprepared for the event that Daffy would in turn 
                    begin to get aggresive towards humanity. This plan requires the two to destroy or immobilise each other, neither of which can be
                    relied on. This plan has the best chance of successfully taking down Bugs, but the variables contained make it an unreliable 
                    defence.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="positions">
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="img/Missile.2.png" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Missile">
                </div>
                <h3>Firepower</h3>
                <p>The secondary contingency is to hit the Bunny with every ounce of explosives available to us. Unfortunately, the calculated 
                    explosive power required to eliminate a being of his calibre would also result in the end of all biological life on this planet. If 
                    such a threat occured that it became neccesary to use this last-resort fallback, an evaucation plan has been developed in the hopes of 
                    keeping humanity alive. The United Nations has brokered a treatywith all nuke-capable and space-fairing nations, that under the 
                    dire threat of the Bugs once the signal has been made, within two days 80,000 people from all corners of the Earth will be evacuated
                    into space, along with samples of flora and fauna that are alreadykept on an emergency space station, and all capable countries will 
                    direct their power onto Bugs's location. It is a suicide call for everyone involved, but it could be humanities only chance at survival.

                </div>
                <h3>Isolation</h3>
                <p>Unlike the other contingency plans, this does not lead to a direct and indefensible threat to humanity. It is a simple idea with a 
                    difficult execution, but should the plan be accurately and effectively completed it may leave us with the tools to safely dispose of the 
                    Bunny as a threat. The solution is to temporarily apprehend the Bunny, long enough to equip him onto a rocket and send him into orbit and 
                    beyond. It is not a permanent fix by any means. Research has proven that he can survive a long, seemingly indefinite time without oxygen.
                    It is also assumed that the vaccum and temperature of space does not affect him. It will not leave us free from the threat and danger he 
                    poses, but it will leave us with crucial and valuable time. Global funds and resources will be pooled together in an emergency task force, 
                    in the hopes that technology and understanding advancements will leave us in a preferential position should he ever find a way to return 
                    to his home.

            <h3>Last Statement</h3>
            <p>We are developing these plans only because compared to Bugs, we are weak and stupid. His knowledge and wisdom far surpasses our own 
                understanding of our world and the greater universe beyond. It is a far-fetched idea that he would become aggressive to humans, after 
                spending so many hours walking with them through the millennia and cultivating their knowledge and ideas by leaps and bounds. His ablilities 
                would give him awareness of any contingcy plans made for him before they have left the lips of whoever is speaking, and that is truly 
                terrifying. Compared to him, humanity is powerless.
